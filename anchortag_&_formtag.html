            From early 1950-1990s internet was under some educated people,at that time there were static text pages in order to operate with these text pages people have to remember the path/URL of these text pages,which was written in a journal. It was a complicted and time consuming process,but in 1990s Tim Burner Lee introduced a language called HTML.Html (hyper text markup language) was same as xml language both were markup languages but the difference between them was html introduced a tag called anchor tag .Anchor tag was assoicated with a action (event) that made the content written with in the tag clickable due to which we were able to connect two pages using this tag .This gave the idea of www (world wide web).

            Problem was arised in the static wesites of e-commerse,people who want to buy from the e-commerce web sites,they used to spent a lot of time in chosing the product but in order to buy the product they have to contact the customer in contact section of the websites but the line used to be already occupied by the another customer beacuse of this they used to lose thier customers this problem was raised in UN .So form tag was introduced form tag is a container it has no value without the html controls/widgts.Form tags consists of different attributes (action="") its tell where to send data (method="") it tells how to send the data etc Because of form tag websites became dynamic i.e first in client server architechure server used to serve to the client that is websites were static read only but after form tag was introduced client could also write to a server.There is a general convention that all name attributes of input tag should have unique value except some of the tag eg: input type="radio"
